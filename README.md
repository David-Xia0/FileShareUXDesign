# SOFTENG350-A3: Group 10

This project was for the purposes of designing the user interface for a file sharing web application similar to google drive and drop box. The main focus was on UX design.

This project consisted of a domain familiarisation and user needs analysis. Then after the implementation of our first prototype, we performed usage testing with two candidate and formulised the results.

All information can be found with the report.
